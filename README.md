# Peierls stress

Here, we calculate the Peierls stress of edge and screw dislocations on {110}, {112}, and {123} planes in eight pure metals, including CrMoNbTa-A, CrNbTaW-A, MoNbTaV-A, MoNbTaW-A, Cr, Ta, V, and W. The suffix '-A' denotes pure metals simulated with the [_A_-atom potentials](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.104201). In [another repository](https://github.com/shuozhixu/FLAM2020-LSR), we calculated the local slip resistance (LSR) in four MPEAs. Since LSR in an MPEA is equivalent to Peierls stress in a pure metal, calculations of the Peierls stress are similar. For more information on these two quantities, read [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2020.10.042).

Since there are two types of dislocations, three types of planes, and eight metals, you will have 3 x 8 x 2 = 48 Peierls stress values.
