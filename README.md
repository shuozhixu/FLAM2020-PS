# Peierls stress

Here, we calculate the Peierls stress of edge and screw dislocations on {110}, {112}, and {123} planes in eight pure metals, including CrMoNbTa-A, CrNbTaW-A, MoNbTaV-A, MoNbTaW-A, Cr, Ta, V, and W. Since there are two types of dislocations, three types of planes, and eight metals, you will have 3 x 8 x 2 = 48 Peierls stress values.

Note that the local slip resistance (LSR) is just a name for the Peierls stress in HEAs. Therefore, calculations of the Peierls stress can follow [the FLAM2020-LSR repository](https://github.com/shuozhixu/FLAM2020-LSR). For more information on the LSR and Peierls stress, please read
